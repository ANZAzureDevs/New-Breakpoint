## 2022-03-10 - Series 2 - Episode 7: Let's brew Java on Azure 

If you missed the live show you can catch the episode on YouTube once published.

Azure provides you with best-in-class solutions to build, test and deploy Java apps. With its managed services, Azure enables you to ship software faster — without worrying about infrastructure. Plus, you can take advantage of the extensibility of the Azure ecosystem to innovate and meet customer demands.

Microsoft's [Manoj Ravikumar Nair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/powershellpro/) walked us through how you can migrate and scale Java apps on Azure using all your favourite tools and frameworks, such as Spring, Tomcat, WildFly, JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere, Maven, Gradle, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Jenkins, Terraform and more.

## 2022-02-02 - Series 2 - Episode 6: Next-level Infrastructure-as-Code with Bicep and DevOps 

If you missed the live show you can catch the episode on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/K0BNRQQKvww). The live segment Q&A is not included in this video, so if you'd like to see what was asked, along with answers, check out the [episode Q&A page](S02E06LiveQandA.md).

Bicep makes it easy to deploy your Azure resources as code. But deploying Bicep code automatically requires you to know about pipelines, service principals, source control, and many other concepts.

In this episode, [John Downs](https://twitter.com/jdwns), Senior FastTrack Engineer from Microsoft, will talk through how you can get started building your own Azure deployment pipeline with Bicep, Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions.

## 2021-12-07 - Series 2 - Episode 5: Demystifying OAuth, JWTs and Azure AD for Developers

If you missed the live show you can catch the episode on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mf7StZ62_R0). The live segment Q&A is not included in this video, so if you'd like to see what was asked, along with answers, check out the [episode Q&A page](S02E05LiveQandA.md).

Building applications to make use of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication and authorisation requires developers to have familiarity with OAuth, Open ID Connect (OIDC) and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). In this episode, [Graeme Foster](https://twitter.com/graefoster), Cloud Solution Architect from Microsoft, will use a fun interactive demonstration to familiarise developers with OAuth flows, Application Registrations and how to work with JWTs. 

In the episode you'll learn about what's inside ID and Access tokens, what Scopes and Roles are and how to use them, and, intriguingly... why there’s a Pixie (PKCE) lurking in your Azure AD flows!

- Migrate applications to the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL): https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-migration
- Add app roles to your application and receive them in the token: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps
- Summary of the main differences between Azure AD Endpoint v1 and v2, with a focus on client libraries and supportability: https://nicolgit.github.io/AzureAD-Endopoint-V1-vs-V2-comparison/
- Interesting blog post 'The State of the Implicit Flow in OAuth2': https://brockallen.com/2019/01/03/the-state-of-the-implicit-flow-in-oauth2/

## 2021-11-18 - Series 2 - Episode 4: Azure Application Services on Kubernetes with Azure Arc

If you missed the live show you can catch the episode on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/2mUpbTPUBh0). The live segment Q&A is not included in this video, so if you'd like to see what was asked, along with answers, check out the [episode Q&A page](S02E04LiveQandA.md).

In this show, Microsoft's [Chris Reddington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisreddington/) walked us through how to run Azure App Service, Functions, Logic Apps and more on an Azure Arc-enable Kubernetes cluster and these clusters can be run on-premises or hosted in a third-party cloud. We saw how this approach allows you to take advantage of App Service features while also maintaining corporate compliance by hosting apps on infrastructure you manage. This also allows you to buy applications to take advantage of Azure Application Services and run them in Azure and elsewhere which is great for business continuity or disaster recovery.
