## 2024-11-14: New Breakpoint S4 Ep5 SBeyond BaseRAG: using GraphRAG to get more from your GPT

In this episode of New Breakpoint, Michelle Sandford and Graeme Foster delve deep into the world of RAG. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By combining the strengths of traditional retrieval methods with the generative power of LLMs, RAG enables models to access and incorporate relevant information from external sources, leading to more accurate, informative and contextually relevant responses. But it has presented limitations.

Enter GraphRAG. Join us for a live demonstration of the transformative potential of GraphRAG. Witness its capabilities, learn how it can be applied to various use cases and discover the practical steps to implement this groundbreaking technology in your own projects.

Don’t miss this opportunity to learn:

✅	The challenges and limits of traditional RAG.

✅	The power of knowledge graphs

✅	How GraphRAG leverages knowledge graphs to better understand the relationships between entities in a document, enhancing LLM responses.

✅	How to get started with GraphRAG using the Microsoft SDK.


Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, this episode will equip you with the knowledge and tools to unlock the full potential of GraphRAG.

Graeme will present insightful examples of how GraphRAG works taking you through its core building blocks. He’ll also provide an overview of the Microsoft SDK that makes it easier to implement GraphRAG.
With pointers to additional resources and research, this engaging episode will get you off and running with a sound understanding of how to implement GraphRAG and what it can help your organisation achieve.

To mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we’re devoting May’s episode to celebrating accessibility in the workplace and in our work. Host Michelle Sandford, Microsoft Developer Engagement Lead, ANZ & Asia, will lead a fascinating conversation with two guests who are helping people find success by encouraging them to learn and work in ways that best suit their abilities.

We welcome Michelle Wong, the founder of CoderDojo code club for neurodivergent kids in Mandurah, Western Australia, and Sarah James, Director Insights and Data at Capgemini, who’s also a club mentor and board member of Autism Academy at Curtin University.

We’ll shine a light on the personal and business value of creating an engaging and supportive environment that nurtures diverse skills. Michelle and Sarah will share their insights on the role of mentorship in these initiatives. They’ve encouraged successful technology careers among young people by creating places where they can explore and share their passions in ways that best suit them.

We’ll also dig into the benefits of accessibility – how it accommodates not the few, but the many. Accessibility features, such as subtitles, initially designed for a small percentage of users, have proven to benefit broad audiences, making life easier and better for all. We’ll share approaches and resources that will help you build accessibility into your code from the ground up – saving you time in the long run and making your creations more useful to many more people.
