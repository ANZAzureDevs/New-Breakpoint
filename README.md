## 2021-11-18 - Series 2 - Episode 4: Azure Application Services on Kubernetes with Azure Arc

If you missed the live show you can catch the episode on YouTube (link published here when ready). The live segment Q&A is not included in this video, so if you'd like to see what was asked, along with answers, check out the [episode Q&A page](S02E04LiveQandA.md).

In this show, Microsoft's [Chris Reddington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisreddington/) walked us through how to run Azure App Service, Functions, Logic Apps and more on an Azure Arc-enable Kubernetes cluster and these clusters can be run on-premises or hosted in a third-party cloud. We saw how this approach allows you to take advantage of App Service features while also maintaining corporate compliance by hosting apps on infrastructure you manage. This also allows you to buy applications to take advantage of Azure Application Services and run them in Azure and elsewhere which is great for business continuity or disaster recovery.
