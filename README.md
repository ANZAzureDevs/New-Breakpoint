## 2021-09-09 - Series 2 - Episode 2: Migrating PHP Laravel web apps to Azure App Service

If you missed the live show you can catch the episode on YouTube in the next couple of weeks - we'll update this page with the link. The live segment Q&A is not included in this video, but we'll post a transcript of the questions and answers once we have episode on YouTube.

Azure App Service is a great place to host your web applications, and one of the most common web frameworks, PHP, is deeply supported on the platform. This episode we are joined by Microsoft's [Rajan Bhayana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajan-bhayana-3933b547/) to talk through App Service's PHP support and how you migrate your existing Laravel applications to Azure.
