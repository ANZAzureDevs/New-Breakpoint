## 2021-03-03 - Microsoft Ignite Special - Quantum Computing | Tips and tricks for career development

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode on the [Microsoft Ignite Website](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/04115eee-8a9f-4956-b871-2bdc128bde6a).

Our show this week focused on two distinct topics - (1) quantum computing and (2) career development.

[Dr Chris Granade](https://www.cgranade.com/) and [Dr David Reilly](https://equs.org/users/prof-david-reilly), both from Microsoft, joined us to talk about [quantum computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-quantum-computing/) and [Microsoft MVPs](https://mvp.microsoft.com/Overview) [Lisa Crosbie](https://lisacrosbie.com/about/) and [Amey Holden](https://twitter.com/ameyholden) had a discussion on tips and techniques that they've found useful for developing their careers in tech.

If you want to dig deeper on either topic here are some great places to start:

- [Quantum computing foundations](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/) is a good place to get started with learning about this topic
- [Control Hardware announcement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/full-stack-ahead-pioneering-quantum-hardware-allows-for-controlling-up-to-thousands-of-qubits-at-cryogenic-temperatures/) - see the cutting edge work Dr Reilly's team is doing at University of Sydney.
- [Azure Quantum Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/quantum/) (currently in public preview)
- [Microsft Cloud Training Events](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-training-events) includes all webinars and other similar events where you can attend (and sometimes receive free exam vouchers)
- [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/) is a great place to get hands-on guided training online.

## 2021-02-25 - Episode 3: Community discussion - how has the last year affected communities?

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/TVjeIg9yn7Q).

Without a doubt the last year has been one like none of us has experienced before! In this show we meet with five Australian community members and leaders to find out what it has meant for them and their communities.

We heard from [Melissa Houghton](https://twitter.com/meliss_houghton), [Sammy Herbert](https://twitter.com/SammyHerbert), [David Gardiner](https://twitter.com/DavidRGardiner), [Somy Ayazi](https://twitter.com/SomyAyazi) and [Ross Mullen](https://twitter.com/MrRossMullen) about what's changed about the way their communities operate.

Learn about how going online has changed the way people come together, how has accessibility to content been delivered (or not) and what insights have people gained about how to keep communities together.

Here's some great community and other useful links provided by our guests today.

## 2021-02-18 - Episode 2: "Truck or Not Truck" with Angela, Dinc and Stuart

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/WQT3Bt6R5io).

This week New Breakpoint featured three of Microsoft Australia's Cloud Solution Architecture team from Canberra - [Angela Cibiras](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelacibiras/), [Dinc Kaniskan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinc-kaniskan-0bb1b434/) and [Stuart Eggerton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seggerton/). 

The team ran through an interesting scenario of bringing scale to object detection and classification by demonstrating how you can take a Jupyter notebook, convert it into Python-based Azure Functions and then use these Functions to dected where images contain trucks or not.

We looked at the solution from three different angles:

- Pure data scientist working in Jupyter Notebooks and Machine Learning (ML).
- The data engineer who took the Notebook and ML to Azure Functions.
- Operationalising the solution - configuration management and telemetry.

Here are the follow-up links for the episode:

In this episode we introduced New Breakpoint to Australian developers and met with Sydney-based Microsoft Cloud Advocate [Anthony Shaw](https://tonybaloney.github.io/) whose focus is Open Source and Python. 

Anthony showed us how you can quickly build serverless solutions using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) with Visual Studio Code using a great demo scenario.
