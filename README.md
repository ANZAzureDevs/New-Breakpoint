## 2026-01-08: New Breakpoint S5 Ep 7: Microsoft Agent Framework Explained: Smarter Workflows, Better Tools, Bigger Demo

In this episode we dive into the evolution from Azure AI Foundry-built agents to the newly upgraded Microsoft Agent Framework, using the refreshed Contoso Bike Store demo to spotlight what’s changed, what gaps are now filled, and how workflows, hosting, DevUI, and the new AG‑UI all come together to create production‑ready agent experiences. 

We explore why workflows still matter even when agents can choose their own next step, how Foundry agents and the Framework complement each other, what new tooling exists for runtime observability, and the fastest path for developers to get started. 

Join us for a practical, future‑focused tour of how Microsoft is redefining the agent development stack:

🔍 Topics include:
• The building blocks for building Intelligent applications  
• Foundry Agents and the Microsoft Agent Framework 
• What problems does Microsoft Agent Framework solve?
