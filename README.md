## 2021-06-17 - Episode 13: DrumBeat.ai and Azure AI - helping identify ear disease early 

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/xLzlaJl4IWI).

What if we could broaden the impact of medicine by empowering non-specialist practitioners to pre-screen people using technology developed using AI? Artificial Intelligence (AI) is best used as an augmentation to human capabilities, and not as a replacement, and in this episode, Microsoft's [Kris Bock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisbock/) is joined by leading investigators [Associate Professor Narinder Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/narinder-singh-95595a13/) and [Dr Al-Rahim Habib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-rahim-habib-584957177/) to talk about how DrumBeat.ai is making use of Azure's AI capabilities to build such a screening tool.

## 2021-05-20 - Episode 11: Automation with Power Platform, Azure Functions and Static Websites

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Iv9yaBHjq6E).

Cloud technology offers developers a smorgasboard of services to help them build solutions to solve all types of problems.

What if you were rolling out a competition program that your customers sign up for? You'd need to be able scale things like collection of customer preferences, generation of personalised resources, and making sure all the legal T&C's matched up to the customer.

This week [JT](https://twitter.com/jtango18) from Microsoft joins us to walk through how he used Power Platform, Azure Functions and Azure Static Websites to solve just this scenario when rolling out Cloud Skills Challenges in Australia.

## 2021-05-13 - Episode 10: A day in the life of an API with Todd Whitehead

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/g7kTCEADd04).

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are one of the keys to modern development. In this episode Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect [Todd Whitehead](http://twitter.com/todwhitehead) demonstrates how Azure can accelerate the design, development and deployment of public and private APIs.  

In just 15 minutes he will walk through the development lifecycle of an API from prototype to production, using just a handful of Azure services along with tools developers are already familiar with.

Learn how easy it is to build your own APIs and make them available to both pro developer and low/no-code consumers.

## 2021-04-29 - Episode 9: The Great Debate! Tabs versus Spaces! 

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OzSv4ae6-Xo).

So, do developers who use tabs take four or eight steps at a time, or do developers who use spaces care more for accuracy than tabs-based developers?

In this episode we revisit this age-old debate that has existed since bugs were physical insects found in computers! What team are you on?

Team Tabs and Team Spaces will debate the merit and drawbacks with each other's white space insertion method... watch out for sneak attacks and unexpected counter-points! 

Do you get paid more for coding in spaces or tabs? Can we answer that in 15 minutes?!

## 2021-04-22 - Episode 8: Building resilient applications with Azure SQL Database 

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/vEdvUxULf8A).

Whether your application is a monolith, a set of micro-services, or somewhere in between, the one design challenge you will always face is building resilience into it.

Developers sometimes overlook how to improve the resilience of their data store, so in this show we're joined by [Mohamed Kabiruddin](https://twitter.com/mdkabir), Senior PM on the Azure SQL Database team, along with two of our Cloud Solution Architecture (CSA) team [Adnan Akram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnan-akram-6538953/) and [Junchi Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junchi-liu-83631671/) to discuss how you can build resilient multi-Region applications while using Azure SQL Database.

## 2021-04-15 - Episode 7: Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Well-Architected Framework (WAF) for developers

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/W1tAala3WbY).

Azure provides such a large canvas for developers to build solutions that it can often times be hard to know where to start, or if you are using Azure effectively.

Microsoft built the Cloud Adoption (CAF) and Well-Architected (WAF) Frameworks as a way to help those moving to, and building on Azure ensure they are on the right track.

This episode we are joined by two of Microsoft Australia's [FastTrack](https://azure.microsoft.com/programs/azure-fasttrack/) Senior PM team - [Rupal Mudholkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupal-thakkar-mudholkar/) and [Ronel Vosloo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronel-vosloo-7131305/) - who will walk us though CAF and WAF and what they mean for developers.

We only had a short period to cover CAF and WAF at a high level so here are a few follow-up links so you can go deeper where you want to.

## 2021-03-25 - Episode 6: Community discussion - tangible ways to help women in tech

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/FG-as0lDEyA).

Creating a diverse and inclusive tech industry should be a full-time focus for all of us, but sadly in many instances it is only a once-a-year focus when International Women's Day happens.

Two members of our community team, [Melissa Houghton](https://twitter.com/meliss_houghton) and [Sammy Herbert](https://twitter.com/SammyHerbert) were joined by leads of women in tech communities around Australia - [Akanksha Malik](https://twitter.com/akankshamalik96), [Bronwen Zande](https://twitter.com/BronwenZ), [Kate Kirwin](https://twitter.com/KateKirwin) and Katrin Schmidt - to look how we can go beyond the hashtags and morning teas and make tangible differences to help support women in tech.

## 2021-02-18 - Episode 2: "Truck or Not Truck" with Angela, Dinc and Stuart

If you missed the livestream you can catch the episode [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/WQT3Bt6R5io).

This week New Breakpoint featured three of Microsoft Australia's Cloud Solution Architecture team from Canberra - [Angela Cibiras](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelacibiras/), [Dinc Kaniskan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinc-kaniskan-0bb1b434/) and [Stuart Eggerton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seggerton/). 

The team ran through an interesting scenario of bringing scale to object detection and classification by demonstrating how you can take a Jupyter notebook, convert it into Python-based Azure Functions and then use these Functions to dected where images contain trucks or not.

We looked at the solution from three different angles:

- Pure data scientist working in Jupyter Notebooks and Machine Learning (ML).
- The data engineer who took the Notebook and ML to Azure Functions.
- Operationalising the solution - configuration management and telemetry.
